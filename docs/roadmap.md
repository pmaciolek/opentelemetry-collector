# Long-term Roadmap

This is the long-term, draft Roadmap. Note that this a vision document that reflects our
current desires. It is not a commitment to implement everything listed in this roadmap.
The primary purpose of this document is to ensure all contributors work in alignment.
As our vision changes over time maintainers reserve the right to add, modify, and _remove_
items from this roadmap.
